**The Gist of It:**

  Pi-Controller serves 2 main purposes:
    - (1) to allow a user (my dad; but also maybe you) to define a set of basic rules to govern the operation of GPIO pin outputs based on the state of other GPIO pins.
    - (2) to allow a user to define scheduled events to govern the operation of GPIO pin outputs so long as they do not conflict with the basic rules of operation defined for the GPIO pin.
